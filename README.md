# hasnode-webapp-challenge

## Purpose: To get better at coding

## Resources:

- Hashnode Article Series: https://blog.zt4ff.dev/beginner-to-advanced-challenge-over-80-web-applications
- Repo for Specs: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas 

## Format: 
Each challenge will be in it's own folder. I will attempt to complete the challenge and addon to stuff as I see fit. 

Language can be any but I will prefer JS, TS, or C# since this is to practice coding for web dev.
